## About

This project is my first React project, created as part of my journey as a new React learner. It's a great way for me to apply what I've learned and explore React's features in a real-world project. The UI is responsive, ensuring that it renders correctly on every device. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the website, providing a modern and consistent look and feel.Additionally, the course cards and their details are created dynamically using an API, enhancing the scalability and flexibility of the application.
